# QuantBot army recovery

Custom-game Hard and Brutal bots use a house-level army posture, rather than
asking every unit to decide independently whether the whole army is losing.
Campaign roles, support bots, and Easy/Medium retain their existing pacing.

## Dispatch and the military limit

The default outnumbered threshold is an observed enemy advantage of at least
1.5 times the effective friendly ground force. That blocks a fresh main ground
attack while healthy, deployable military value is below 80% of the configured
`militaryValueLimit`. Reaching 80% removes this particular veto; readiness,
recovery, and emergency base defence still apply.

For an 80,000-credit configured limit, the bypass starts at 64,000 credits.
This denominator stays fixed even when Brutal's unit override permits building
past the normal limit. A zero unit override still means unlimited production.
This feature adds no production cap. A nonpositive military-value limit has no
meaningful percentage reference and does not grant an automatic bypass.

Limit accounting and tactical strength serve different purposes. The bypass
uses actual purchase prices weighted by remaining health, including deployable
combat aircraft. Ground-wave readiness and strength are assessed separately.
Harvesters, transports, inactive cargo, units inside repair yards, and units
reserved for repair do not count as deployable attackers. Human orders take
priority. Enemy assessments use observed hostile teams and exclude neutral
sandworms. Allies contribute only where they can support the assessed fight.

## Retreat and rebuilding

The saved postures are Offensive, Withdrawing, and Recovering. The normal
strategic trigger requires a complete 90-second combat-loss window, at least
1,500 credits lost, losses of at least 20% of the starting deployable force,
confirmed enemy losses below 65% of own losses, and corroborating deterioration
in readiness or front strength. These defaults are tuning parameters, not a
claim that purchase price predicts every unit matchup.

A badly outmatched local wave can withdraw before the whole house meets the
attrition trigger. Serious danger to the main army or production core can
trigger an immediate withdrawal. Ordinary raids and one isolated survivor must
not cause house-wide panic.

While recovering, the bot holds fresh troops at a protected rally and recalls
the tracked wave in bounded batches. Emergency defenders and repair remain
available. Recall uses forced movement in Area Guard: the engine suppresses
new target acquisition during movement and restores local defence on arrival.
The rally belongs to a real defended base cluster. Units use dispersed slots
and an assembly area that grows with the army. Existing movement orders and
path-queue backpressure prevent repeated path submissions. Each call issues at
most 12 recall orders; above 150 queued requests it permits replacements of
pending work and at most two fresh requests, preserving progress under contention.

Recovery requires assembly and a quiet period before ordinary resumption.
Bounded reassessment avoids waiting indefinitely for perfect intelligence.
Fresh attacks require a complete dispatch budget assembled at home, with a
shared reachable objective when an observed target exists. Only gathered units
are selected; remote reserves can catch up without holding a ready wave back.
The existing commitment percentage still subtracts troops already deployed.
Recovery's assembly share and the 80% military-limit dispatch exception are
separate checks.

## Batteries and special units

Once two refineries, a heavy factory, and a repair yard exist, important bases
can grow overlapping rocket batteries towards the observed enemy approach.
Coverage demand drives the goal: an opening battery starts around 8–12 turrets
and a mature base can exceed 24. First cover for critical buildings, remote
colonies, economy reserves, power rules, construction exits, and movement
corridors retain priority. Battery construction is spread across passes.

Devastators, Sonic Tanks, and Deviators retain their shared outer production
budget. Selection within that group uses per-type recorded return/loss evidence
and an exploration prior, so candidate ordering alone does not favour the first
affordable type. The strength model does not reuse those scores as unit damage
weights.

## Verification and limits

`quantbot_army_recovery` exercises the real-engine integration alongside unit
policy tests and existing custom/campaign/production probes. Important checks
include the 80% boundary, minor raids, recovery/resumption, old-save migration,
ordinary save and scoped observer AI continuation, legal battery sites, and actual
movement of a large recalled army. Changes to saved state and multiplayer
behaviour require explicit format/protocol gates.

Purchase price and health provide a cheap, deterministic strength proxy. They
do not model every counter, splash hit, terrain bottleneck, or human manoeuvre.
Confirmed hostile fatalities use the victim's original-house purchase price,
independently of telemetry. Friendly fire, support units, repeated damage on a
dead object, and deviation rewards without a hostile fatality do not credit the
kill ledger. The existing own-loss callback supplies only the item type, so
borrowed units' own-loss cost remains an approximation using this house's price.
Full-match results must be read with these limits; fixture success does not
establish improved win rate.

The continuation probe starts from a canonical ordinary load and crosses the
unit/build phase boundary. It compares saved bot bytes, all unit orders, every
object's physical digest, RNG and the tested house's exact credit balances for
100 frames, and checks fresh survey reconstruction before both build passes.
Repeated ordinary loads compare complete house-inclusive digests. An observed
one-credit difference in another house's pre-existing city checkpoint accounting
means this is not certification of general full-world spectator parity.
